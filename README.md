# FilgatExtractor
This programme extracts the texts from a corpus stored in a docx document and stores the texts in different txt files. The names of the resulting files are derived from the siglum of the text in the docx document. If the siglum was not parsed properly, the txt file will be named "CHANGEME".

# Installation

Install NodeJS - https://nodejs.org/en/.
Open the programme directory in the command line terminal.
Run `npm i`.

# Execution
Add the Word file in the input folder and rename it "corpus.docx".
Run `node index.js` or `npm run start`.
